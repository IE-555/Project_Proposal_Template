## Proposed Project Title

- **Write a brief, but descriptive, title here**

--- 

## Project Type
*[Your group has two options for the course project.  Please select **one** option and provide the corresponding relevant information.]*

### Option 1 - Research Paper
*[Remove this section if you are **NOT** choosing Option 1.]*
> Students may identify a relevant paper from an archived journal which features an algorithm/heuristic designed to solve a particular problem. This algorithm should be coded in Python and validated against the results published in the paper. A final report describing (a) the problem itself, (b) an overview of the solution procedure, (c) a description of how the test data were generating, (d) a summary of the various functions employed to execute the code, and (e) a “how-to” guide for running the Python code is expected.

#### Reference
- *[Provide a citation to the journal article, including title, authors, journal name, year.]*

#### Problem Description
- *[Provide a description of the problem defined in the reference article.]*

#### Algorithm Description
- *[Provide a description of the algorithm defined in the reference article.]*

#### Source Data
- *[Concisely explain where you plan to obtain source data on which to test the algorithm.]*

#### Motivation
- *[Explain why you chose this paper.]*
 
### Option 2 - Online Data Analysis
*[Remove this section if you are **NOT** choosing Option 2.]*
> Students may develop their own programming project. In this option, students must identify a source of online data, which will be dynamically imported via Python. The Python code must utilize these data to either make decision support recommendations or provide a detailed analysis of the data. A YouTube video describing the mechanics of the Python code will be required, in addition to a “how-to” guide for running the code. All source code must be submitted, and the course instructor must be able to execute the code without errors.

#### Data Sources
- *[Provide a description of each data source you plan to use.]*
    - *[For each data source, provide a link to the API documentation.]*

#### Analysis Plan
- *[Clearly explain the analysis you will conduct with the data.]*
- *[Clearly justify how the chosen source data will enable your team to conduct this analysis.]*

#### Motivation
- *[Explain why you have chosen to conduct this analysis.  What is it about this data that interests you?]*
